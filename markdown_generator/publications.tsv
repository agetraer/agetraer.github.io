2/1/21	Climate-Driven Variability in Runoff Erosion Encoded in Stream Network Geometry	Geophysical Research Letters	Alexander Getraer and Adam C. Maloof		"Climate signatures recorded in the geometry of branching streams provide insight into climate and landscape histories on Earth and other planetary bodies. Recent findings establish that branching angles are narrower and stream profiles are straighter in more arid climates. However, these two observations have been attributed to different mechanisms. Here we demonstrate that for US watersheds the difference in slope between confluent streams increases with humidity, and streams with a greater difference in slope tend to branch at wider angles. Our observations suggest a branching angle endmember of 90\u2103 when stream slopes are most different. Using a simple model of runoff erosion, we show how this variation in relative stream slopes can be explained by a shift in streamflow accumulation across climate regimes. These findings connect previously observed climate signatures in branching angles and stream profiles, suggesting that both record the same control of aridity on surface flow."

12/20/24	Limits to timescale dependence in erosion rates: Quantifying glacial and fluvial erosion across timescales	Science Advances	"Joel A. Wilner, Bailey J Nordin, Alexander Getraer, Rowan M. Gregoire, Mansa Krishna, Jiawen Li, Derek J. Pickell, Emma R. Rogers, Kalin T. McDannell, Marisa C. Palucis, and C. Brenhin Keller"		"Earth’s topography and climate result from the competition between uplift and erosion, but it has been debated whether rivers or glaciers are more effective erosional agents. We present a global compilation of fluvial and glacial erosion rates alongside simple numerical experiments, which show that the “Sadler effect,” wherein geological rates show an inverse relationship with measurement timescale, comprises three distinct effects: a measurement thickness bias, a bias of erosion and redeposition, and a bias introduced by not observing quiescent intervals. Furthermore, we find that, globally, average glacial erosion rates exceed fluvial erosion rates through time by an order of magnitude, and that this difference cannot be explained by Sadlerian biases or by variations in hillslope, precipitation, or latitude. These findings support observations of increased erosion rates following Cenozoic cooling and glaciation, and reveal the importance of glacial erosion over millennial to orogenic timescales."
